# Sainsburyâ€™s Entertainment Test
Hello Sainsbury's dev crew!

I decided to go for the latest and greatest.
- react
- Alt.js as Flux implementation
- Karma
- ES6 in code and tests

## How you test it

To install deps: `npm install`

To run tests: `karma start`

To see the result: `webpack`, then open `index.html`

Or, easier `webpack-dev-server` then open `http://localhost:8080/`

That's it!
